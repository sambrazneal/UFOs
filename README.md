# UFOs

## Resources
Software: HTML, JavaScript, CSS

## Overview of Project 
Used JavaScript to display UFO data in a table and then manipulated the data with filters. Then added the data to an HTML file. 

## Results
The webpage for UFO sightings was created.

Users are able to filter through data easily by entering the date, city, state, country, and/or sighting shape they would like to filter by. 



## Summary
A few drawbacks from this website is the outdated data and case-sensitivity when filtering the data.

### Recommendations
1. To address my concern for outdated data, I think pulling data from a source that is continually updated with recent sightings would keep the site updated and relevant . 

2. Adding a filter to search for key words in the comments would be a great addition. Users would be able to search silimar sightings without needing to know when or where the sighting occured.
